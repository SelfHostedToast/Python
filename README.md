This repository contains all of my Python Projects.

To aid with my self-learning journey I am going to use this readme space to implement notes, tips, etc regarding Python.

"py2exe" is capable of "freezing" python projects into executable programs in the exe format for windows with the updside that the python interpreter does not need installation on the host machine.
